2. Clone your new repository
3. The template will automatically configure itself on your first push:
   - Renames all placeholder references
   - Sets up the project structure
   - Configures GitHub Actions

## Development Setup
start by renaming the name in pyproject.toml file to your project name

```toml
name = "<add your project name>"
```

Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup.bat
```
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Creating Releases

Releases are automatically created when you push to main. The version bump is determined by PR labels and/or description:
- `major`: Breaking changes
- `minor`: New features
- `patch`: Bug fixes

## Documentation

- Run locally:
  ```bash
  poetry run mkdocs serve
  ```
- View at: http://localhost:8000
